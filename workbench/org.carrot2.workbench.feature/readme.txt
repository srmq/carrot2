Carrot2 Document Clustering Workbench
-------------------------------------

Carrot2 Document Clustering Workbench (DCW) is a standalone GUI application
you can use to experiment with Carrot2 clustering on data from common search
engines or your own data.

The DCW requires a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version 1.8 or later. To
start the DCW, run carrot2-workbench.exe (Windows), carrot2-workbench (Linux)
or open carrot2-workbench.app (Mac). Note that on MacOS the application is
unsigned and needs to be open using Finder's "open" menu command.

To enable more console debugging pass the following option:

./carrot2-workbench -vmargs -Dlog4j.configuration=log4j-verbose.xml
